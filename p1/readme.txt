2. To compile the source code, please run the command "make" since I have a makefile ready
3. To execute the program, please type a.out < datafile
   a. datafile is the file that will be redirected to stdin 
   b. a.out is the executable for the program
   
   c. more on datafile:
   The 1st line of the datafile contains the dimension of the openGl window and the rest of lines specify
   the points of the polygons. Other than the 1st line of the datafile, the rest follows the same format as the one
   introduced in the project 1's assignment sheet.
   
   For example,
   1000 500         dimension of the opengl window
   2                number of polygons

   4                number of points for the 1st polygon
   0 0              coordinate of 1st point
   0 100            coordinate of 2nd point
   100 100          coordinate of 3rd point
   100 0            coordinate of 4th point

   3                number of points for the 2nd polygon
   -100 -100        coordinate of 1st point
   -200 -200        coordinate of 2nd point
   -190 -150        coordinate of 3rd point
